        <li><b><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PUNY 
          is the PERL language special interest group under the aegis of the NY 
          Software Industry Association</font></b></li>
        <li><b><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our 
          purpose is bring the value of PERL to the business and educational communities 
          of New York through classes and technical presentations</font></b></li>
        <li><b><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
          will also develop active interest it the future of PERL to generate 
          financial support and in-kind development efforts from large institutions 
          and corporations. </font></b></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are 
        very strong voices in the wilderness calling for changes in OS's as well 
        as new varieties of perl so much so that both their directions will be 
        forever altered. Already I can see several kinds Perl, nano, micro, single 
        threading, multithreading and Perl/OS. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PERL has 
        a utilitarian philosophy which has allowed it to grow to support an unlimited 
        variety of operations, data storage, and documentation needs on virtually 
        every platform. PUNY seeks to embolden perl to stand on its own both as 
        an applications development language and an OS interface.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Linux has 
        been finding its way onto tens of millions of desktops in every part of 
        the world, yet we who have been using Unix style systems for a decade 
        or so have found that is has actually become worn with time. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The world 
        of users will soon realize that their new Linux OS is a mature server 
        system and not necessarily a handy tool to query their universe of knowledge. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Every PUNY 
        member must get specific benefits from the SIG and regional code and OS 
        releases will be designed for the needs and desires of all our members. 
        The need for Perl in business, education and development is so strong 
        that any OS, including the Win32 family, will be welcomed. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This "PUNY 
        release" will be constructed by SIG members who have skills, but will 
        be seen as a black box by users. PUNY2 will be that new generation possibly 
        in a modular h/w configuration.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> PUNY will 
        be integrated with work groups who will maintain a web neighborhood constructed 
        wholly of Perl. The C++Sig and Perl Mongers have pledged to support by 
        adapting their own classes and technical meetings for NYSIA members. Other 
        publicly available languages, such as Lisp variants, will be discussed 
        as they relate to systems integration. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The web goal 
        is to create a community that would attract high school and college students 
        as well as our peers constructed wholly of Perl. It will start as a thinclient 
        desktop with such tools as mail, group ware, and data mining and storage. 
        With time, probably very little, it will grow into a full-blown broadband 
        service specifically designed the way we would like. It would also be 
        a tremendously valuable asset. </font></p>
