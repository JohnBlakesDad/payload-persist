<FONT FACE="CG Omega" SIZE=4><P>Last Meeting, Feb 22<SUP>nd</SUP> </P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>Thank you all for coming, there were about 20 future and experience perlers in attendance.</P>
<P>I feel our first meeting was a huge success.  In fact, the very next morning Denny was contacted by the NYPC group to host the Linux Sig.  </P>
<P>PUNY will be at NYPC (and other)  install fests  in full force to assure that perl is compiled and installed correctly on everybody's machines.</P>
<P>My 5-minute perl class stretched for two hours, but I am very hopeful that I gave the attendees the building blocks to get started on their own perl projects.</P>
<P>We then proceeded to a Q+A period where David (perl monger) and I fielded some really tough questions.</P>
<P>I gave the lecture fully aware that I was going to overreach my goal of teaching basic syntax, but a major responsibility of an "evangelist" is try to make people aware of the full power of perl's unique and powerful object oriented syntax.  I reached my goal of giving the full tour of complex structures, class packages and persistent objects using only basic code snippets.  I just hope I did not lose too many along the way <FONT FACE="Wingdings">&#74;</FONT>
</P>
<P>I also introduced the PUNY release of Debian Linux and the LibOS, but not as deeply as I hoped though I must admit that I have not been able to work on these projects as much as I have wanted.</P>
<P>I modified my lecture on the fly and I will be encapsulating what I learned into class notes.  With the help of others and possibly forays into other languages, we will very likely distribute our version of HOW-TO documents.</P>
<P>Thanks again for coming, and we hope to see you at our future events.</P>
